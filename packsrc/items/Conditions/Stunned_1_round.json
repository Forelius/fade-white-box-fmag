(In some other types of stun, the stun might go on awhile, allowing the stunned character to attack, ineffectually, after a certain amount of time has passed.)</p><p>Also, while stunned, the victim moves at one-third the normal movement rate for whatever speed he is attempting. He suffers a -4 penalty to all his saving throws. He suffers a +4 penalty to his armor class (thus an AC 5 becomes a 9). He cannot concentrate, cast spells, or use magical items. He cannot use general skills. Any weapon mastery skill he possesses above Basic level is reduced to Basic level.</p>",
