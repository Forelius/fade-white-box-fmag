    "description": "<p>To search for traps, the player must specify the exact area they are examining, such as a 20-foot square room or a 20-foot corridor. Searching takes one turn (10 minutes) per area, and the Dungeon Master rolls to determine success. Thieves have a percentage-based chance to detect traps, determined by their level, while dwarves have a superior chance to locate large mechanical traps, such as pit traps, due to their natural affinity with stonework. The DM may modify the difficulty for especially hidden traps. Non-thief characters generally cannot detect traps unless their presence is obvious​​.</p>",
