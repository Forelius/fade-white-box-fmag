    "description": "<p>The saving throw for Spells or Magic Staff includes resistance against magical effects cast by rods, staves, wands, or through spells. A successful save, rolled on a d20, often reduces or negates the spell's effects entirely. This saving throw is applicable to numerous magical attacks, such as charm spells, fireballs, or paralysis effects, and covers damage, control, or debilitating conditions caused by magical devices or spellcasters. The target number for success is based on the character's class and level.</p>",
