    "description": "<p>The saving throw against \"Stone or Paralysis\" protects a character from attacks or effects that could freeze them in place (paralysis) or turn them into stone. If the saving throw is failed, the character becomes immobilized or petrified, depending on the effect. Paralysis leaves a character aware but unable to act, while petrification turns the character and their carried equipment into a stone statue. The duration or permanence of these effects is specified by the source, and successful saving throws avoid them entirely​​​.</p>",
