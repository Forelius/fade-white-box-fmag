    "description": "<p>A thief who reaches the ninth level or higher has the option to establish a secret hideout, typically located within an urban setting. This hideout attracts the attention and loyalty of less experienced thieves who are eager to learn from a seasoned expert. The thief assumes the title of Guild Master, and those who join him become members of his Thieves Guild. In return for a share of their earnings, the Guild Master provides these apprentices with protection from local authorities to the best of his ability.</p>",
